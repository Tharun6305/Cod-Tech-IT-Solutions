Here i give very simple Overview of all my Three Project .
Mianly we need first observe the problem statement and the requirement based on that we need to develope the code and add extra features also.
These Documentation is very simple for understanding the flow of the projects and what is the purpose what we done for that.
Here There are Three Project They are Console Based Calculator and Student Grade Management System and Number Guessing Game .
Here see the Clear Data about These all.

CONSOLE BASED CALCULATOR:-
--------------------------

Here's the documentation for the com.calculator package and the ConsoleBasedCalculator class:

Package com.calculator
The com.calculator package contains classes related to a console-based calculator application.

Class ConsoleBasedCalculator
The ConsoleBasedCalculator class is a Java application that provides a simple console-based calculator for performing basic arithmetic operations.

Features:
Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus division operations.
Provides a user-friendly command-line interface for input and output.
Methods:
main(String[] args): The main method of the application, responsible for starting the calculator and interacting with the user through the console.
Logic:
Displays a welcome message and prompts the user to input two numbers and select an arithmetic operation.
Reads the user input from the console.
Performs the selected arithmetic operation on the input numbers.
Prints the result of the operation to the console.
Loops continuously to allow users to perform multiple calculations until manually terminated.
Usage:
Compile the ConsoleBasedCalculator class.
Run the compiled Java application.
Follow the on-screen prompts to input two numbers and select an arithmetic operation.
View the result of the operation displayed in the console.
Repeat steps 3-4 to perform additional calculations.


NUMBER GUESSING GAME:----
--------------------------
Package com.random.Controller
The com.random.Controller package contains classes related to controlling the logic and behavior of a web application for guessing a random number.

Class FindRandomNumberController
The FindRandomNumberController class is a Spring MVC controller responsible for handling HTTP requests related to the guessing game.

Annotations:
@Controller: Indicates that the class serves as a controller component in a Spring MVC application, allowing it to handle web requests.
@Autowired: Automatically injects an instance of RandomNumberSer into the controller.
Endpoints:
@GetMapping("/startgame"): Handles GET requests to /startgame endpoint. Loads the initial page for the guessing game.
@PostMapping("/findnumber"): Handles POST requests to /findnumber endpoint. Processes user input for guessing the random number.
Dependencies:
RandomNumberSer: Autowired service component responsible for generating random numbers.
Methods:
LoadPage(Model model): Handles GET requests to /startgame endpoint. Loads the initial page for the guessing game.
FindRandNumber(String number, Model model, HttpSession session): Handles POST requests to /findnumber endpoint. Processes user input for guessing the random number and updates the game state.
Parameters:
number: The user-provided number guessed for the random number.
model: The Spring MVC model for adding attributes to the view.
session: The HTTP session for maintaining state between requests.
Logic:
Parses the user-provided number as an integer.
Retrieves the randomly generated number from the RandomNumberSer service.
Checks if the guessed number matches the randomly generated number.
Updates the message in the model based on the comparison result.
Increments the count of attempts stored in the session.
Checks if the maximum number of attempts (5 in this case) has been reached. If so, redirects to the endgame page.
Returns the index page (index.html) to continue the game if the maximum number of attempts has not been reached.
Usage:
Access /startgame endpoint to load the initial page for the guessing game.
Input a number and submit the form.
The controller processes the guess and provides feedback.
Repeat steps 2-3 until the game ends or the maximum number of attempts is reached.


STUDENT GRADE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM:-
--------------------------------

Package com.student.Controller
The com.student.Controller package contains classes related to controlling the logic and behavior of a web application for managing student data and marks.

Class StudentController
The StudentController class is a Spring MVC controller responsible for handling HTTP requests related to student data and marks management.

Annotations:
@Controller: Indicates that the class serves as a controller component in a Spring MVC application, allowing it to handle web requests.
@Autowired: Automatically injects instances of repositories into the controller.
Endpoints:
@GetMapping("/login"): Loads the login page for teachers to enter marks.
@GetMapping("/addmarks"): Loads the form for filling in student marks.
@GetMapping("/registration"): Loads the teacher registration form.
@GetMapping("/loginvalidation"): Validates teacher login credentials.
@PostMapping("insertlogindata"): Inserts teacher login data if the teacher login does not exist.
@PostMapping("/insertdata"): Inserts student marks data based on subject-wise evaluation.
@GetMapping("/getData"): Retrieves student details and marks data.
@PostMapping("/delete"): Deletes student marks data.
@PostMapping("/edit"): Edits existing subject data.
@PostMapping("/update"): Updates subject data.
@PostMapping("/search"): Searches student data based on roll number.
Dependencies:
StudentDetailsRepository: Repository for managing student details.
TeachersLoginRepository: Repository for managing teacher login data.
SubjectsAndMarksRepository: Repository for managing subjects and marks data.
Methods:
Various methods for handling different HTTP requests related to teacher login, student marks insertion, data retrieval, deletion, editing, updating, and searching.
Usage:
Access /login endpoint to load the login page for teachers.
Provide login credentials and submit the form.
If login is successful, access /addmarks endpoint to fill in student marks.
Fill in student marks and submit the form.
Access /getData endpoint to retrieve student details and marks.
Use /delete, /edit, /update, or /search endpoints for further operations on student data.
